An iOS app that allows CoreML models to be easily compared and tested in real-time using the Vision Framework. The purpose is to seamlessly compare different models when detecting objects or quickly test your trained model, without the need to build your own test app.

Apple provides [here](https://developer.apple.com/machine-learning/) a list of models which could be used. Any valid, classifying CoreML model is supported.

The app makes use of CoreML models in 3 different ways: integrated in the app (the model programmatic interface is generated by Xcode), as app resource and as externally provided model.

The app can be found on the App Store [here](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/coremlcompare/id1378662341).

## Features

- Import a new model either by using the pasteboard or after downloading the .mlmodel file on the device (MIME type)
- Changing the model default name and color
- Each model can be configured with a different minimum confidence level - between 40% and 90%
- Stopping specific models from detecting objects - using 4 models in parallel is quite processing-intensive
- Can classify hot dogs (or bananas)

## Implementation notes

- By design choice, the integrated model (MobileNet) cannot be edited, replaced or removed. It can be disabled though (on current app run).
- If no imported model exists on the device, the model used as app resource (SqueezeNet) will be automatically added to the app.
- The same model can be imported multiple times. But only one model file will exist on the device, meaning if one of these model will be removed, the others will automatically be removed. This can be avoided when using different file names for the same model.
